## Quick start
This is a normal flutter app. You should follow the instructions in the [official documentation](https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/install).
This project uses **BLoC** (business logic component) to separate the business logic with UI itself.
It's recommended to do self-study about it before jumping into the project [here](https://bloclibrary.dev/).
And also on this project uses **Modularization** approach to separate each feature ([core](https://github.com/rrifafauzikomara/MovieCatalogue/tree/master/core), [shared](https://github.com/rrifafauzikomara/MovieCatalogue/tree/master/shared), [ui](https://github.com/rrifafauzikomara/MovieCatalogue/tree/master/lib/ui) modules).
You can do self-study about it in [here](https://medium.com/flutter-community/mastering-flutter-modularization-in-several-ways-f5bced19101a).

## How to run Flutter App
Before run the app, make sure you have an emulator running, or a device connected over USB and debugging enabled on that device.
Then you need to register the `API_KEY` from www.themoviedb.org then enter the `API_KEY` into ***api_constant.dart*** file

```
static const apiKey = "HERE";
```


If you want to generate file `*.g.dart`, you can use this command on terminal. But before you running that, make sure go to [core](https://github.com/rrifafauzikomara/MovieCatalogue/tree/master/core) module first using `cd` command. For example `cd core`. Then you can run the command below.

One time build:
```console
flutter pub run build_runner build
```
or you can watch for changes and rebuild automatically
```console
flutter pub run build_runner watch
```


### Run Flutter app between Flavor for development and production with command prompt
Development
```console
flutter run --flavor development --target=lib/ui/launcher/main-dev.dart
```
Production
```console
flutter run --flavor production --target=lib/ui/launcher/main-prod.dart
```
